# EMC ECS Service Broker PCF Tile

## Description

This tile is created using the [Pivotal Tile Generator](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/2-10/tile-generator.html) and deploys a service-broker application as a CF app. It deploys a sister project, the [ECS Service Broker](https://github.com/thecodeteam/ecs-cf-service-broker). For more instructions on using the broker once deployed, refer to the [Pivotal Network documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/ecs-service-broker/).

This tile implements the following tile generator errands:

* **deploy-service-broker**:  Deploy the broker as a CF app.
* **register-broker**: Register the deployed broker with CF as service broker.
* **destroy-broker**: Deregister and delete the app from CF.

Upon completion, PCF Tile will support dynamic plans which enables the broker to
be configured from the PCF Ops Manager.

### End-user Broker Usage

CLoud Foundry end-users can create and bind services to their applications using the `cf` CLI application.

```
cf create-service ecs-bucket unlimited my_bucket
```

This creates a bucket of the `ecs-bucket` service with the `unlimited` plan and the name: `my-bucket`.  To bind
an application to this bucket:

```
cf bind-service my-app my-bucket
```

The default will give `my-app` "full control" of the bucket.  To give a reduced set of permissions, you can provide
additional configuration parameters with the `-c` flag:

```
cf bind-service my-app my-bucket -c '{"permissions": ["read", "write"]}'
```

Valid permissions include:
 * read
 * read_acl
 * write
 * write_acl
 * execute
 * full_control
 * privileged_write
 * delete
 * none

### Testing

Currently, tests are implemented for tile migrations using [Jest.js](https://jestjs.io). To run the tests install the `jest-cli` globally with NPM or yarn:

```shell
# Install Jest.js
$ npm install -g jest-cli

# Run jest
$ jest
```
